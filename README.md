# Turtle manager

Collection of my own scripts for working with CC: Tweaked's turtles. Includes generic pathfinding, dashboards and the works.

## Getting started

First get the bootstrap script onto the turtle or computer:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahmerh/turtle-manager/refs/heads/main/bootstrap.lua
```

Next bootstrap the device, you can select from the following roles:

- Quarry `bootstrap quarry`

From there on, check usage below for each role
